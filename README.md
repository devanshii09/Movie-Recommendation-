Project: Movie recommendation system

This project includes a Python application (app.py) for data processing and a Jupyter notebook (notebook86c26b4f17.ipynb) for analysis, visualization, and further interpretation.

Requirements

The project requires the following Python libraries:

	•	Flask: For running the web application.
	•	pandas and numpy: For data processing.
	•	matplotlib and seaborn: For data visualization.
	•	scikit-learn: For any machine learning tasks.

These can all be installed via the requirements.txt file.

Usage

	1.	Running the Python Application (app.py):
To execute the application: python app.py

	2.	Running the Jupyter Notebook (notebook86c26b4f17.ipynb):
Use this notebook for additional data analysis and visualization: jupyter notebook notebook86c26b4f17.ipynb
The notebook includes:
	•	Data exploration steps.
	•	Graphical analysis of processed data.
	•	Optional machine learning model training and evaluation.

File Overview

	•	app.py: Main script for data processing and/or application functionality.
	•	notebook86c26b4f17.ipynb: Interactive notebook for data analysis, visualization, and additional processing.
	•	requirements.txt: Lists all dependencies for the project.
